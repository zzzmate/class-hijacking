# class-hijacking
class hijacking internally with a dll

i believe its called class hijacking but who really cares, basically i made a program inside of that i made a Player class then I created a Player pointer variable which means basically I created a Player, and with reverse engineering u reverse the class, then the addresses and with all of this u can make ur own entity in the dll 


so for an example u have a game reversed it, perhaps its a class that creates the entities, then u remade the class in dll, got the addresses, and u can make entities (probably that class contains the entity type variable, this is not, but its just an example so useless af)
